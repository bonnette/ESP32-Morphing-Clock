# ESP32 Morphing Clock
Based on HariFun's design found at https://www.instructables.com/Morphing-Digital-Clock/ <br><br>
There are many adaptations of this Morphing clock design. But I was unable to find one that worked with the Wemos D1 MINI ESP32 clone,
and the PxMatrix library, and the ezTime library, and the wiring scheme that is used by HariFun. <br> 
So, I took the PixelTime example code found in the PxMatrix library, and HariFun's code and cobbled together what is here in this repository.<br><br>
As of today (12/18/23) the clock works and it morphs. But, I would like to add the weather functions found in other morphing clocks as well as other features. 
That is why there are other libraries not currently used included in this repository. <br>
I'm still working on that stuff and I will add it here when I figure it out.
